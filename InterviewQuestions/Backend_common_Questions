Q1. The company is transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices. As part of this transition, you are tasked with designing a microservice responsible for user authentication and authorization. Describe how you would design this microservice, considering principles of OOPS for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Discuss how the microservice will interact with other services in the system. SQL and Database Optimization:
Q2. The company's flagship application is experiencing slow query performance in certain database operations. As a Senior Software Engineer, outline the steps you would take to identify and optimize these slow queries. Discuss indexing strategies, query optimization techniques, and any considerations for denormalization or normalization based on the specific use cases.
Q3. A critical component of the system relies on asynchronous messaging for real-time updates. Describe how you would design and implement a messaging system to ensure reliable message delivery, handle message ordering, and manage potential issues like message duplication. Discuss any patterns or technologies you would employ for efficient message processing.
Q4. The system needs to perform real-time analysis on large datasets. Discuss the algorithms and data structures you would consider for efficient data processing and analysis. Touch upon topics such as algorithmic complexity, scalability, and trade-offs between different algorithms. Explain how you would ensure the system remains responsive under heavy analytical workloads.
Q5. The company is acquiring a business with a legacy system written using procedural programming. As part of the integration effort, describe how you would approach the task of integrating the legacy system into the existing object-oriented system. Discuss any challenges you anticipate and how you would maintain a clean separation of concerns while integrating these different paradigms.
